# odin_recipes_2
This repo is a valid one

I recreated this repo because I didn't know how to copy my ssh key of the original repo

My reflections BEFORE starting the project
My current project requires me to create a website with recipes. 
I will do it with the help of html. 
The first part of my document will be occupied with the boilerplate code, 
this is the basic building block of every html document. Then i will fill it with other elements, 
which consist of tags and their content.
