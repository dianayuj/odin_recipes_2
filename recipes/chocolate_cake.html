        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease and line two 20cm/8in sandwich tins</li>
            <li>For the cake, place all of the cake ingredients, except the boiling water, into a large mixing bowl.<br> Using a wooden spoon, or electric whisk, beat the mixture until smooth and well combined.</li>
            <li>Add the boiling water to the mixture, a little at a time, until smooth. (The cake mixture will now be very liquid.)</li>
            <li>Divide the cake batter between the sandwich tins and bake in the oven for 25–35 minutes, or until<br> the top is firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to cool completely, still in their tins, before icing.</li>
